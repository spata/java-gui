    <body bgcolor="white"> This package contains example code for use of SWT layouts.
        <ul>
            <li><b>filllayout</b> - this layout is the basic layout that fills a composite
                based on the orientation used in the constructor (default is
                SWT.HORIZONTAL). This layout will always use the available widgets
                to fill the composite.</li>
            <li><b>rowlayout</b> - this layout organises the widgets into rows within the
                composite. It will reduce the number that it puts on each row depending on the
                size of the composite. Uses the RowData layout data object to hint to
                the layout how to control chold widgets.</li>
            <li><b>gridlayout</b> - this layout expands on the rowlayout by letting you
                define the layout into rows and columns (a grid if you like). This is the
                most versatile and widely used of the layouts. </li>
                <li><b>formlayout</b> - this layout is a form based layout that uses relative positions of widgets to </li>
